Weekly Meeting - Week 02 - 2021.10.16~2021.10.23
Date: 2021.10.21 Recorder: Zejie Yan
路Have a deep debate on the framework of the project, and in the end ideas are unified.
路We realize a fact that some design cannot be made without hardware, so they are postponed. 
路The UI design was preliminary done, and it was shared on the meeting with teammates. Ideas are exchanged on the UI deisgn.
路Questions are collected:
 1. Data security. We wonder if we need to consider the privacy problem when we collect data from
     family environment.
 2. UI design restriction. We need to know if there is any request from clients on the web design or there is existing 
     UI deisgn for us. (We found this question when we started designing.)
 3. The type of data we need to collect. The types of data we need to collect is not clear.
 4. The time when the hardware can arrive.
