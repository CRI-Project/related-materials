·Summary of the Sprint 03:
  Issues encountered:
  Server is attacked by hacker on the presentation of weekly meeting. 
  As the server is still under the attack, the original server is abandoned after discussion with teammates. 
  As a result, the database was destroyed, and all the data recorded in database is erased. 
  A new server is implemented to replace the original one. 
  A new database is rebuilt in this sprint, and the data is collected again to do related test. 
  A mass of repeated work was made, so it costs plenty of time.  
  Review:
  The process is delayed, but the process is still move on but with lower pace. 
  Retrospective:
  Although attack costs us plenty of time and energy, we still learn from this unfortunate experience. 
  In the future, we would do measures to prevent such an accident, and know what to do after the accident. 
  The team still works as a whole, this attack challenged us, and we still move on.
