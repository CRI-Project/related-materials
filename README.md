# Project Introduction
*Project Name: A Pollution Intensity Monitoring System for Residential Heating*

This project is a part of the large project behave of Climate Response Ireland. The scope of this project is defined as follows. 
- A prototype device that consists of a Raspberry Pi and gas sensors (potentially multiple sensors)
- A Python client library for sending data to and receiving command from a cloud-based server
- A design of an efficient message routing scheme for sensor data and control command transmission that can scale to multi-million devices 
- A software system for device and sensor management and sensor data visualisation

# Project implementation process
To balance the workload of this project, work is separated into five sprints where each sprint is in two-weeks long. Based on the type of work, six long-term stories are designed and distributed to these five sprints roughly (see following diagram)

- [front-end design part repository](https://github.com/CRI-Project/front-end-design)
- [back-end design part repository](https://github.com/CRI-Project/back-end-design)
